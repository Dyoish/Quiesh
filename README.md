# Quiesh: A Python Quiz Project

This project was created since the current generation is significantly different from earlier generations. Todayâ€™s students find the traditional reviews method tedious, so we developed a fresh, and entertaining method that also allows for question-answering. This game aims to make the quiz or review enjoyable so that the student won't become bored while reviewing. Some students don't want to review because of the traditional method of reviewing bores them. We created the game to encourage people to review more frequently, and they will also enjoy it.

# Features of the project
